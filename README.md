**Business Problem**
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).

**Dataset**
The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday. The dataset has the following features:

- User_ID:	User ID
- Product_ID:	Product ID
